This program is a 2 player version of 3D Tic-Tac-Toe using a 4x4x4 grid layout created in MIPS assembly language.

HOW TO RUN:
This program can be run using the MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator (MARS).
MARS can be downloaded for free from this link.

After downloading the .asm file simply open the file using MARS and then using the drop down menus click Run->Assemble. After that click on the green button near the top of the screen to run the program.

DESCRIPTION:
The game asks the first player which piece (X or O) they want to be and then alternates turns for X and O to put their piece on the board. After every turn the game asks if the users would like to continue with a Y/N prompt. Because this was made as an alternative to playing on paper, the game does not check to see if anyone wins.
