This program is a 2 player version of 4D Tic-Tac-Toe created in MIPS assembly langaguge using MARS.

The game asks the first player which piece (X or O) they want to be and then alternates turns for X and O to put their piece on the board. After every turn the game asks if users would like to continue. Because this was made as an alternative to playing on paper, the game does not check to see if anyone wins.
