This program is a 2 player version of 3D Tic-Tac-Toe created in MIPS assembly language.

HOW TO RUN:
This program can be run using the MARS
http://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/mars/download.htm

The game asks the first player which piece (X or O) they want to be and then alternates turns for X and O to put their piece on the board. After every turn the game asks if users would like to continue. Because this was made as an alternative to playing on paper, the game does not check to see if anyone wins.
